I finished up my first week of live classes of bootcamp and there is a lot to unpack. 

First I did learn a lot and after only a few days already feel pretty comfortable with the terminal. 

### Git and Github are different
Yeah, I thought they were the same thing. I didn't realize that in your terminal you can have version control on your own machine. 

### In your terminal
This kind of stuff made sense to me because of my past life. As a former Industrial Engineer I was pretty strict on version control for blueprints (CAD drawings), procedures and work instructions.

The command below was the first step to initialize and create a new repository.
```
 % git init
```

The command below adds new and modified files into a staging area.
```
% git add --all
```

Finally the command below puts everything in the staging area and makes a permanent snapshot of the current state of your repository. 
```
% git commit -m "description of what changed"
```
