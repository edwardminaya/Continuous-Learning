This week we dived into rails and was able to do a lot of cool stuff but I'm still a little iffy on some things. 

I decided to created this step by step cheatsheet to help me learn and lay it all out on one place for references. I'm going to follow the rails guid link below: 
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

Assumption: Already have rails and ruby installed on your machine

## 1. Creating A New Application

The first step is to create a rails application with the following command in your terminal.
Name will be the actual name of your application

```
$ rails new name
```
This will create a directory and install the gem dependencies.
