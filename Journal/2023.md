### Learnings

This week we had more practice with React. After having to build a frontend for the blog api and mini capstone api I feel better with how the library functions. It's been really fun to see a website come together. Some of the things we added to the frontend included routes to different pages, search filter, login and signup links to appear when not logged in and flash messages. JavaScript can do a lot and I'm excited to continue to learn more about it's abilities.

OpenAI has been all over my social media and it's been interesting to see how developers are using it. I've learned to use it to help me code and find solutions to certain problems but also I've learned how other platforms are connecting to chatgpt and using it as well. Learning how to code has helped me understand more about how things are quickly developed and integrated into platforms so quickly.

I'm also interested in seeing how Jack Dorsey's new platform, blue sky, will do as it replicates Twitter but with different algorithms for the feed. It's decentralized and will have different feed algorithms that the user can pick. I saw a quick video of it and it was cool to see how a skeleton version of twitter was put together.

### Learnings

This week we had a couple of days off and I was able to spend some time learning some SQL and learning how to create and handle databases/tables. I learned how to alter columns in postgres and running db:migrate in rails to update the changes there which was cool to see the two come together. I also created a wordle clone application that can be played in a terminal. It's a little weird with double letters but I got most of the basic features working. At this point I feel very confident with Ruby.

JavaScript has been a little more difficult than anticipated. I am struggling to see how everything comes together in React but I know this is how I felt when I started with Ruby and Rails so I know it'll take a some time to get there.

I have started thinking about jobs and what role I would like. It's an exciting process and I feel ready to start a role. I think the best way to learn is to jump right in and making things happen. So I hope that I can find a company that is willing to give me that chance. I'm interested in backend development so I would like to focus more on backend technologies like SQL, APIs and Data Structure.

I also feel pretty good with keeping up with algorithms and doing leetcode and hackerrank.

### Learnings

This week we had some practice with HTML and CSS. I have a repo for creating a vanilla HTML/CSS webpage. I explored different techniques and styling tips. We also spent some time whiteboarding and practicing the process of explaining how to solve a problem and writing out the code for it.

We also spent time preparing for job searching. I enjoyed looking for opportunities and seeing job descriptions that not only make sense to me now but I also feel like I am ready and capable to do some of the jobs. I know that getting the first job will be difficult but I'm ready to take on that challenge.

### Learnings

This week I had my own personal project and decided to do a Todo list application. I'm starting to feel comfortable getting an application up and running and getting all the models and associations working together.

#### Half Way Point!

I'm half way done with my bootcamp and I feel like it's been going by pretty fast. We've covered a lot and I feel pretty good about where I am with Ruby, Rails, HTML and CSS. I also feel comfortable learning new technologies. I've been interested in backend stuff like Django, MongoDB, etc.

The areas I feel less confident in are probably the authentication and testing part. I still think I need to dive into that a little more and gain a better understanding.

#### Where do I see myself?

Coming into the bootcamp I thought I would enjoy backend more but right now I'm still not sure what kind of role I would like. After this week I really enjoyed frontend and using bootstrap but I also enjoy databases.

### Learnings

#### Bootstrap

I was a big fan of bootstrap to quickly put together a pretty elegant site. I really enjoyed the documentation and how quick you can get things up and running. Although I do see its creative limitations.

#### Pulling paramaters

It was tricky to pull parameters from different pages into another. I still don't fully get it but I feel a lot better after working as a team on it. Seeing it come together as a group was great. I'll definitely need to practice this aspect of rails.

#### Git and Github pull requests

It feels great to build on what I have already learned about certain topics. I feel very comfortable using git and github now. Learning to do pull requests was tricky at first but after deliberately practicing I got the hang of it. I did run into some issues with my github account and authentication.

I reached out to the TA for help and was able to regenerate my token to get my commits and pull requests done correctly. It used to continually ask for my password but after generating a new token and making sure the expiration date was set correctly I got it to work.

#### [First Team Project](https://github.com/mikemccomb/air-bnb-app)

This week I had my first team project and I was very lucky to have a great team. I learned how pull requests are done live and how important it is to communicate what is being worked one. I learned a lot about creating models and views in erb and using bootstrap. I also learned to keep things within a scope. It's easy to divert and do too much which can really break the code everyone is working one.

Making things come together as a team was very satisfying. I also appreciated how we were able to mob program tough issues and come together to find a solution.

Something I would have done differently is giving ourselves time to double check our pull requests and being more descriptive with what we did each pull. In a real work environment I can see this being an issue. Our last pull missed a chunk of code that was worked on for a long time but overall we did communicate pretty well. In my past life documentation was crucial for revision changes and I see the need to bring that detailed documentation aspect of my career into pull requests.

#### Understanding HTTP requests and debugging

I had a hard time understanding how HTTP requests worked and debugging was not straight forward.

I found out that the terminal also has error codes which made debugging a lot easier. After a few debugging sessions I started getting the hang of HTTP requests especially for ensuring that the CRUD actions are working and populating the database correctly.

#### Testing Rails

I still don't fully understand the syntax of the testing code. At first seeing all the failed tests in my terminal was a lot to take in but it definitely helped me understand the connections of each file.

I got a lot of help from my instructor and really appreciated being thrown into all the erros because debugging is a great way to learn how things work. As an industrial engineer I've had to troubleshoot machines and doing so I became very knowledge about them. Same goes for software which has been a fun experience.

### 4Ds (Deliberate Practice, Decomposition, Discovery, Debugging)

This week I focused on debugging with the rails testing portion and also deliberate practice. I have gotten very comfortable with Ruby and being able to solve algorithms pretty well. I'm hoping to finish up Ruby's practice problem sets and then move to JavaScript.
