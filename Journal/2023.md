### Learnings

#### Bootstrap
I was a big fan of bootstrap to quickly put together a pretty elegant site. I really enjoyed the documentation and how quick you can get things up and running. Although I do see its creative limitations. 

#### Pulling paramaters
It was tricky to pull parameters from different pages into another. I still don't fully get it but I feel a lot better after working as a team on it. Seeing it come together as a group was great. I'll definitely need to practice this aspect of rails. 

#### Git and Github pull requests
It feels great to build on what I have already learned about certain topics. I feel very comfortable using git and github now. Learning to do pull requests was tricky at first but after deliberately practicing I got the hang of it. I did run into some issues with my github account and authentication.

I reached out to the TA for help and was able to regenerate my token to get my commits and pull requests done correctly. It used to continually ask for my password but after generating a new token and making sure the expiration date was set correctly I got it to work. 

#### [First Team Project](https://github.com/mikemccomb/air-bnb-app)
This week I had my first team project and I was very lucky to have a great team. I learned how pull requests are done live and how important it is to communicate what is being worked one. I learned a lot about creating models and views in erb and using bootstrap. I also learned to keep things within a scope. It's easy to divert and do too much which can really break the code everyone is working one.


Making things come together as a team was very satisfying. I also appreciated how we were able to mob program tough issues and come together to find a solution.

Something I would have done differently is giving ourselves time to double check our pull requests and being more descriptive with what we did each pull. In a real work environment I can see this being an issue. Our last pull missed a chunk of code that was worked on for a long time but overall we did communicate pretty well. In my past life documentation was crucial for revision changes and I see the need to bring that detailed documentation aspect of my career into pull requests.

### Learnings

#### Understanding HTTP requests and debugging
I had a hard time understanding how HTTP requests worked and debugging was not straight forward. 

I found out that the terminal also has error codes which made debugging a lot easier. After a few debugging sessions I started getting the hang of HTTP requests especially for ensuring that the CRUD actions are working and populating the database correctly.

#### Testing Rails
I still don't fully understand the syntax of the testing code. At first seeing all the failed tests in my terminal was a lot to take in but it definitely helped me understand the connections of each file. 

I got a lot of help from my instructor and really appreciated being thrown into all the erros because debugging is a great way to learn how things work. As an industrial engineer I've had to troubleshoot machines and doing so I became very knowledge about them. Same goes for software which has been a fun experience. 

### 4Ds (Deliberate Practice, Decomposition, Discovery, Debugging)
This week I focused on debugging with the rails testing portion and also deliberate practice. I have gotten very comfortable with Ruby and being able to solve algorithms pretty well. I'm hoping to finish up Ruby's practice problem sets and then move to JavaScript.
