### Learnings

#### Understanding HTTP requests and debugging
I had a hard time understanding how HTTP requests worked and debugging was not straight forward. 

I found out that the terminal also has error codes which made debugging a lot easier. After a few debugging sessions I started getting the hang of HTTP requests especially for ensuring that the CRUD actions are working and populating the database correctly.

#### Testing Rails
I still don't fully understand the syntax of the testing code. At first seeing all the failed tests in my terminal was a lot to take in but it definitely helped me understand the connections of each file. 

I got a lot of help from my instructor and really appreciated being thrown into all the erros because debugging is a great way to learn how things work. As an industrial engineer I've had to troubleshoot machines and doing so I became very knowledge about them. Same goes for software which has been a fun experience. 

### 4Ds (Deliberate Practice, Decomposition, Discovery, Debugging)
This week I focused on debugging with the rails testing portion and also deliberate practice. I have gotten very comfortable with Ruby and being able to solve algorithms pretty well. I'm hoping to finish up Ruby's practice problem sets and then move to JavaScript.
